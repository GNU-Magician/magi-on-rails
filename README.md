# README
Edit: This project is now complete. Hooray. No further updates will be made to it probably.

This is my project to set up a blog. Nothing to say about it. You're free to use/study it.
Languages used were Ruby (and Rails), HTML (with Bootstrap), CSS (with sass)
and javascript (with jquery/coffeescript). Long dependency list, eh?
The other gems in the gemfile are as follows:

 * Bcrypt (for passwords)
 * byebug (for debugging)
 
 To run the project, simply use "rails server" (note: you need ruby and rails. obviously.) in the bin folder and
 access the ip/port you set it on (default is 3000) and install the gems in the gemfile using "bundle install"
 . (also in the /bin folder)
